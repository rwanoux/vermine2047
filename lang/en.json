It is observed as well in mammals as in tiny insects, in packs as in solitaries. It inspires hunting, chasing and fighting behaviors essential to feeding, but it only preaches a justified, necessary and vital violence. Depending on peoples and cultures, it has long been symbolized by the lion, the eagle or the hunter, and its warrior values have always taken a certain form of nobility. A predator does not kill: it triumphs. A predator does not flee: it loses, or it dies",

Very common in the plant kingdom, where many flowers and plants have established it with pollinators, this symbiotic relationship is also observed in insects, mammals and human beings. It can be punctual, stemming from blood ties, linked to a territory or a common project, and nothing prevents it from being motivated by profit or interest, as long as it is reciprocal – which distinguishes the Symbiote from the Parasite.",

The Parasite exploits, profits, abuses without remorse, driven by the sole approach of taking what another possesses and needs.

From family cells to multinationals, from organized packs to super-colonies of several billion individuals, the Hive is characterized by organization, hierarchy, dedication and a keen awareness of the role that each must play in the common interest, more than by the notion of community itself.
